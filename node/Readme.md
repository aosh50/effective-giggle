# Momenton coding challenge

### Assumptions

 - One "CEO" per hierarchical table, if multiple "CEOs" each will be displayed in it's own table
 - Invalid manager is handled by printing `<employee> has an invalid manager`, rest of hierarchy will still be printed
 - No Employees or no CEOs will display an error and stop execution
